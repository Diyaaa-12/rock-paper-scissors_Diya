# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game AI

## Overview
This is a simple AI-powered Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer in either **Best of 3** or **Best of 5** mode. The AI selects moves randomly but can be enhanced with predictive strategies.

## Features
- **User vs. Computer Gameplay**: Play against an AI opponent.
- **Game Mode Selection**: Choose between Best of 3 or Best of 5 rounds.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of wins and declares a final winner.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures correct user input to avoid errors.
- **Random AI Moves**: The computer picks moves randomly using Python's `random` module.
- **Motivational Quote**: Displays a quote at the end of the game.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).

### Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rock-Paper-Scissors-AI.git
cd Rock-Paper-Scissors-AI
```

### Run the Game:
```sh
python game.py
```

## How to Play
1. Run the script.
2. Choose the game mode: **Best of 3** or **Best of 5**.
